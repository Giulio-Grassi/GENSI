## What is GENSI? 
**[Imke please help me fill this section up]**

## What’s new? 
GENSI has been rebuilt to prioritise ease of use for researchers. 
Moving from a bullet point description of a survey to a working version in GENSI takes minutes rather than hours. 
This version of GENSI focuses on modularity: every component handles one type of question. You are free to combine the components in any order to achieve the perfect survey. 
The current library of components includes all the visualisations of the previous versions of Gensi, and a few more.
Have you developed a question component with a specific layout or features? Share it with the rest of the community!
