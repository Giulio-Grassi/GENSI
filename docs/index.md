## Welcome to GENSI
GENSI comes with two different handbooks, one geared to Developers or System Administrators, and another one for researchers. 

##[Developer’s Handbook](https://google.com)
##[Researcher’s Handbook](https://google.com)

## What’s new? 
GENSI has been rebuilt to prioritise ease of use for researchers. 
Moving from a bullet point description of a survey to a working version in GENSI takes minutes rather than hours. 
This version of GENSI focuses on modularity: every component handles one type of question. You are free to combine the components in any order to achieve the perfect survey. 
The current library of components includes all the visualisations of the previous versions of Gensi, and a few more.
Have you developed a question component with a specific layout or features? Share it with the rest of the community! 







You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Giulio-Grassi/GENSI/edit/master/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Giulio-Grassi/GENSI/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
